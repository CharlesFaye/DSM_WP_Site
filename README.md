##Djay Sunu Mbay Wordpress website

this is the website of Djay Sunu Mbay's project

##Getting Started 

In order to get some informatiosn about Djay Sunu Mbay's projet, 
I have the idea to conceive also a website that will represent 
globally the project. There are some informations that you can only 
obtain through the website that's why I feel the need to devise that 
website in order to make this project more appropriate and available 
to all platforms.

##Setup 

In order to work with the project you shoud previously install and configure: 
- WordPress : a Content Management System (CMS);
- A local web server like Xampp Server, Wamp Server for local setup or in other cases
  you'll need to host it at a hosting provider.


##Contribution 

I invite anyone else who want to contribute to this project that she/he is welcome. This project 
is far from being finished, so you can contribute to this project and make your own contribution 
by reporting issues, suggesting features and submitting pull requests.
